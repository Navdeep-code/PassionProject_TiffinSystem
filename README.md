# PassionProject_TiffinSystem

Issues:
According to the Feedback, I had to make the most changes in my Database so i have had the changes accordingly but i was facing an issue in making adding the Time Column 
to the bridging table between Schedule and meal table because I did not know how to do that. I made a few failed attempts due to which my project was having a couple of errors
i was unable to solve so i had to make a different project file and made the whole project all over again.So i had to resumit my assignment in the blackboard.



Description:
Eating food is very basic and crucial part of life. So this makes cooking a necessity in
every household but unfortunately in this fast paced life not everyone has time to
cook for themselves. There are small businesses which provides tiffin services for
such people. Their Business can be managed in a more efficient way if they use a
proper system for their services. People would be able to view the menu of the week
as added by the the admin.This Asp.net Entity Framework project serves these purposes
