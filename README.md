# PassionProject_TiffinSystem

Issues: Update view not functioning 

Project Description:
Eating food is very basic and crucial part of life. So this makes cooking a necessity in
every household but unfortunately in this fast paced life not everyone has time to
cook for themselves. There are small businesses which provides tiffin services for
such people. Their Business can be managed in a more efficient way if they use a
proper system for their services. People would be able to view the menu of the week
as added by the the admin.This Asp.net Entity Framework project serves these purposes

Four Models are made for this project:
Food

SchedulexMeal (Bridging table)

Crude operations are added in for all three Models with Views

Future Scope:
-Layout changes and adding more css
-Imlementing more dataController functions with views like listfoodformeals
-Authentication
-Admin and User veiws
-Client side validation
-Server side Validation
